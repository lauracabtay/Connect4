# Connect4

This program was created as part of a graded assignment for a MSc in Computer Science. This is a Connect4 game built using Java.

## Task:
This program should allow a human to play Connect4 against a computer. The game is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four" target="_blank">described here</a>. The game Connect4 is a game that can be played between a human and a computer player, on a 6x7 grid. The goal is to connect 4 tokens either diagonally, horizontally or vertically.

An initial program was provided. Unfortunately, the code:

<ul>
<li>Didnâ€™t compile or run</li>
<li>Was poorly designed (e.g. was largely made up of a huge main function without comments). One of the requirements was to redesign the code to adhere to these principles.</li>
<li>Needed extension to meet an updated specification (more players, more tokens!).</li>
</ul>
